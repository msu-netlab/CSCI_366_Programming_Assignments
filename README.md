Learning Objectives
In this programming assignment you will:

clone and commit to GitHub repositories
Learn how to build a C++ project using CMake
Learn how to test your code using googletest
Overview
Your objective is to implement a basic version of the Battleship game. You will use the standard 10x10 variation of the game . Here is an example of online implementation of the game. Note that the ships in that implementation have slightly different names.

Your implementation will be a client server architecture. This repository provides you with the header files for the client (player) and server implementations (src/Client.hpp and src/Server.hpp), client and server run times (src/client_main.cpp and src/server_main.cpp), and a suite of tests (test/tests.cpp). Your job is to finish the implementation of Client.cpp and Server.cpp to pass all the tests in tests.cpp.

Board Setup
The first step before the game begins is to create a setup board for each player, according to the rules of the game . You will represent the board with a character array, where _ represents water and Carrier, Battleship, cRuiser, Submarine, and Destroyer fields are represented by C, B, R, S, D respectively. For example, your board might be set up as follows:

CCCCC_____
BBBB______
RRR_______
SSS_______
D_________
D_________
__________
__________
__________
__________
Save these boards for both players as player_1.setup_board.txt and player_2.setup_board .txt.

Messages
To play the game, your implementation needs to exchange two types of messages - shot and result. The shot message needs to communicate the grid location of salvo. The result message needs to communicate whether the salvo was a hit, a miss, or if the shot was out of bounds.

You will represent both of these messages as JSON files that the client and server exchange via local disk storage. Assume that the x and y board coordinates are zero indexed at the top-left corner of the board and increase as you go right and down.

Program Operation
The following figure illustrates the operation of the program. (I kept the image from the lecture for continuity.)

system architecture

The player fires a shot by writing coordinates to a player_#.shot.json file. The server reads the shot file, determines the result of the shot, and writes it into player_#.result.json. The player reads the result file and updates the result on its action board player_#.action_board.json.

Program Invocation
To play Battleship you should first start the server by running the run-server executable. Then start the player clients by running two instances of the run-client executable. Unfortunately, the client and server executables will not do anything interesting until you implement Client.cpp and Server.cpp. As you progress in these implementations, your code will pass more and more tests in tests.cpp. When your code passes all the tests, you will be able to run the client and server executables to play the game.

Bonus
I will award one bonus point for each of the following:

Server throws an error if both players start with the same player number. (implementations and tests)

Server sends a different result when a ship is sunk. The client implementation notifies the player when they sink a ship (implementation and tests)

Server detects when a game ends and returns the winner to both players. Player clients display the winner. (implementation and tests)

What to Submit
Submit your work on D2L into the "Programming Assignment 1" folder.

A text file containing a link to a GitHub repository with your solution

A text file alerting the TA if you implemented any of the bonus features, and if so, which ones

Grading
We will grade your submissions based on how many test cases in tests.cpp your solution passes. Note that for grading we will use out own tests.cpp and full size setup board files.
